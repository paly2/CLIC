# CLIC, Command Line Interface Chat

Very basic chat in CLI (useful especially for LANs).

### How to run it ?

- Run the server.
- If you want the server to be accessed anywhere on the Internet, configure your Box to redirect messages from the port 23 to the local server adress.
- Run the client.
- Give the adress of the server (192.168.X.X for a local adress) and press Enter.
- You can now chat ! Enter a message and press the Enter key to send a message.
- Send the message "END" to stop the conversation.

### TODO

- Multi-clients gestion.
- Password authentification and RSA encryptage.
- More developed interface.
